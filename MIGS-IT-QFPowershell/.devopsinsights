        WARNING: Opting of Capabilities is intended for Capabilities that will never apply to this
                 application, not capabilities that just haven't been implemented yet.

        If the "excludeFromScoring" attribute is set to true, then the entire build pipeline will be excluded from being scored
        and will not be counted towards the number of migrated pipelines.
 
        If the "name" attribute is not provided, the excluded capabilities will apply to all pipelines in the repository.
 
        "coreScriptFolder" specifies the root folder of the core-build.ps1. NOTE: Ensure that the folder path starts with root i.e. /.pipelines and not just .pipelines
 
 
        If a reason is not provided for opting out of a capability, that capability will not be opted out of.
